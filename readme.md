# Near-Final Terraform for IaC (Building 3 tier web app)**

To run this web app directly, run terraform in Terraform folder to set up the infrastructures

Problem: The Security group element can't be created following example usage from Terraform . So user need to manually open TCP connection on port 3000 by setting inbound rule, to access the web app UI on created EC2 instance
